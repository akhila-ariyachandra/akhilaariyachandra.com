title: Using 'clsx' or 'classnames' with 'tailwind-merge'

A function that allows the conditional classnames from 'clsx' or 'classnames' to be passed into 'tailwind-merge'.

Combining [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) or [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) with [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) allows us to conditionally join [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes in `classNames` together without style conflicts. Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

```typescript {4-6}
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

function cn(...args: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(args));
}
```
