title: "My two most used ES6 features: const & let, & arrow functions"

**ES6** brought a whole load of convenient feature to JavaScript. I'm going to talk about the two I use the most.

## const and let

Before **ES6** variables were declared with the `var` keyword like

```javascript
var a = "Hello World!";
```

With ES6 there are two new ways to declare variables, which are `const` and `let`.

```javascript
const a = 10;
let b = 5;
```

`let` is the closest to `var` as in they both allow the variable to be reassigned. `const` makes the variable immutable which means a new value cannot be assigned to that variable.
When I write code, my default is to always use `const`, because it makes my code more predictable especially when the file is long. I only use `let` when I need the variable to hold a new value further along in the code, which is rare for me. If I had to give a ratio to the `const` vs `let` declarations I do, I'd say it would be around 20:1. In 3+ years of coding in JavaScript I have never used `var`.

## Arrow functions

Normally in JavaScript we use the `function` keyword to declare a function

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add(1, 2); // 3
```

With arrow functions the same function would look like

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
add(1, 2); // 3
```

Note you can assign an arrow function to `let` or `var` too but it's always better to assign it to `const`.
Arrow functions also allows for implicit return, so the same function can be shortened to

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
add(1, 2); // 3
```

I found the implicit return of arrow functions specially useful when developing in React as it helps cut down the code written by quite a bit.

## Wrapping up

ES6 also has lots of other great features like object destructing, but I'm at a point now where I could not imagine coding JavaScript without the two I just talked about. If you don't use these already, give them a try and check out the rest of ES6 as well. It'll make coding in JavaScript a whole lot easier and fun. I might talk `const` & `let`, & arrow functions in detail in the future (I'm itching to talk about the whole `this` and `bind` mess in JavaScript and how arrow functions solve it).
