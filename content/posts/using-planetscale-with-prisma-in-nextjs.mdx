While looking for a serverless database solution, [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is an awesome option. With awesome features like unlimited connection and non-blocking schema changes, it's an awesome tool to use in our projects together with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

In this post I will show how to quickly setup PlanetScale with Prisma in your Next.js project.

## Setting up PlanetScale

First, install the [PlaneScale CLI](https://planetscale.com/features/cli) and login to your account.

```shell
pscale login
```

Then create your database. I'll be using **"akhilaariyachandra-com"** as the database name.

```shell
pscale database create akhilaariyachandra-com
```

By default the database will be created with the **main** branch. Let's make sure that we cannot make any direct changes to the **main** branch by promoting it.

```shell
pscale branch promote akhilaariyachandra-com main
```

After that, let's create a **development** branch that we can make our changes in.

```shell
pscale branch create akhilaariyachandra-com development
```

Finally we should run the **development** branch locally.

```shell
pscale connect akhilaariyachandra-com development --port 3309
```

## Setting up Prisma

Now that the PlanetScale database is set up for development, let's install Prisma.

```shell
pnpm install prisma -D
```

After that initialize the Prisma Schema.

```shell
pnpx prisma init
```

Then will create the `.env` file with the `DATABASE_URL` variable and the `schema.prisma` file in the `prisma` folder. The `DATABASE_URL` variable will come a placeholder value so replace it with the local database path.

```text title=".env"
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/akhilaariyachandra-com"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you replace `akhilaariyachandra-com` with the name of your database.
</Callout>

Next let's take a look at the `schema.prisma` file. The first change we need to make is to set the `provider` to `mysql`.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma" {9}
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Another change we need to make is to how foreign keys are handled in our database. PlanetScale does not support foreign keys so we need to make Prisma handle them manually using the [`relationMode`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/using-prisma-with-planetscale#how-to-emulate-relations-in-prisma-client) field.

If you have a foreign key in your model, it is important to create an index on that field using the `@@index` [argument](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#index) to prevent perfomance issues as PlanetScale will not automatically create an index on that field because it doesn't maintain it as a foreign key.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma" {11}
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma"
}
```

Now we have to create a model for our database. For this post I'll be creating a model for a basic page view counter.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma" {14-17}
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma"
}

model Views {
  slug  String @id
  count Int    @default(1)
}
```

Once we have done the changes to the schema, we should push them to the database. The usual flow in Prisma with [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) does not work with PlanetScale. We need to push the changes directly to the **development** branch.

To make things easier in the future, let's create a script in the `package.json` file and run it.

```json title="package.json" {3}
{
  "scripts": {
    "prisma:db-push": "prisma db push"
  }
}
```

```shell
pnpm prisma:db-push
```

After Prisma has finished pushing the changes to the database, we need to install the [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client).

```shell
pnpm install @prisma/client
```

Similar to how we created a `package.json` script to push our schema changes to the database, let's create another script to manaully generate the Prisma Client.

```json title="package.json" {4}
{
  "scripts": {
    "prisma:db-push": "prisma db push",
    "prisma:generate": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

We can use the Prisma Client as is, but you might run into the following error because the Prisma Client is initialized repeatedly when a file is changed due to hot reloading.

```
warn(prisma-client) There are already 10 instances of Prisma Client actively running.
```

To prevent this, we can initialize and store a Prisma Client instance to be shared.

```typescript title="prisma/index.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

declare global {
  // allow global `var` declarations
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var
  var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

const prisma: PrismaClient = global?.prisma ?? new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  global.prisma = prisma;
}

export default prisma;
```

Now all we have to do is to import the Prisma Client from this file. You can use [Absolute Imports and Module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) to make an easy path to import it from.

```json title="tsconfig.json" {3,5}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/prisma": ["prisma"]
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Example
import prisma from "@/prisma";

await prisma.views.findMany();
```

## Deploying to production

After we have done our development, we need to push the changes to production. We cannot directly push the changes to the **production** branch in the database. For that we need to create a deploy request.

```shell
pscale deploy-request create akhilaariyachandra-com development
```

Now if we go the database page in the PlanetScale dashboard, we can see the deploy request.

## Deploying the Next.js project to Vercel

Finally before pushing the commited changes so that a new build can be deployed in Vercel, make sure that you add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your project settings.

To get the connection URL, go the database overview and click the "Connect" button.

<PostImage
  src="/posts/using-planetscale-with-prisma-in-nextjs/connect-button.png"
  width={1329}

  title="Connect button"

Then set "Connect with" to **Prisma** and add the connection URL to the Vercel Project.

Finally you are ready to deploy to Vercel.
