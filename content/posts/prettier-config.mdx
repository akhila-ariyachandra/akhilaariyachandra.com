The Prettier Configuration I use for all my projects.

<Callout type="info">
  Updated on 9th September 2023. With the defaults in [Prettier
  3.0](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/07/05/3.0.0.html), there is no reason for
  me to use a custom Prettier config other than for plugins like the [Tailwind
  CSS Prettier
  Plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier).
  So with that being the case, I've removed my custom configuration.
