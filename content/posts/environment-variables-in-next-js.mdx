> Updated on 18th May, 2020 to reflect the how [Next.js v9.4+](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#new-environment-variables-support "New Environment Variables Support") handles the `.env` file.

> Updated on 23rd April, 2020 to reflect the changes on how Vercel handles [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/blog/environment-variables-ui).

Often we need to use certain variables like the database path or authentication secrets without committing them to the repo.

## For Next.js v9.4 and above

[Next.js 9.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4) made handling environment variables a lot more easier. All we need to do now is the create the `.env` file and Next.js will load it automatically.

<Callout type="warn">
  Never commit the **.env** file. Make sure to add it to **.gitignore**.
</Callout>

By default the environment variables will not be included in the client JavaScript bundle. If you do want to include any variables in it it has to be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

```text title=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIRST_SECRET=firstSecret
SECOND_SECRET=secondSecret
```

In the above example `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIRST_SECRET` can be accessed but `SECOND_SECRET` can't be accessed in the client code (such as the React Components).

### Deploying to Vercel

To start, install, log into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/download) and link it to a project if you haven't already.

```shell
npm i -g now
now login
now
```

Then use the following command to set the Environment Variables in the deployment environment.

```shell
now env add
```

## For Next.js v9.3 and below

Since [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/ "Next.js") uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/ "Webpack") we can use the [dotenv-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-webpack) dependency to load variable from a _.env_ file to our Next.js application.

Let's start by installing dotenv-webpack as a dev dependency.

```shell
npm install dotenv-webpack -D
```

Next we need to modify the Webpack configuration in Next.js. This is done through the `next.config.js` file.

First import the dotenv-file dependency.

```javascript title="next.config.js"
const Dotenv = require("dotenv-webpack");
```

Next export the config object with the default Webpack config function.

```javascript title="next.config.js" {3-7}
const Dotenv = require("dotenv-webpack");

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    return config;
  },
};
```

All we need to do now is add the dotenv-plugin into the Webpack plugins array.

```javascript title="next.config.js" {5-6}
const Dotenv = require("dotenv-webpack");

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    // Add the new plugin to the existing webpack plugins
    config.plugins.push(new Dotenv({ silent: true }));

    return config;
  },
};
```

Now you can use environment variables in the application. For example, if your _.env_ file is like this,

```text title=".env"
AUTH_SECRET=verysecret
```

You can use the variable like this, `process.env.AUTH_SECRET`.

<Callout type="warn">
  Never commit the **.env** file. Make sure to add it to **.gitignore**.
</Callout>

### Deploying to Vercel

If you are using a Git provider like Github to deploy the Application in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home), you can't use _.env_ file. This is the reason we set the _silent_ property when adding dotenv-webpack plugin, to prevent any errors because of the missing _.env_ file.

```javascript title="next.config.js" {6}
const Dotenv = require("dotenv-webpack");

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    // Add the new plugin to the existing webpack plugins
    config.plugins.push(new Dotenv({ silent: true }));

    return config;
  },
};
```

Instead of the _.env_ file we will use the [Environment Variables UI](https://vercel.com/blog/environment-variables-ui) available in Vercel.

To start, install, log into the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) and link it to a project if you haven't already.

```shell
npm i -g now
now login
now
```

Then use the following command to set the Environment Variables in the deployment environment.

```shell
now env add
```

Finally to make the variables available in the client JavaScript bundle, we need to add one more property to the Next.js config. Add a new property called `env` and list all the environment variables you want in the client JavaScript bundle as follows.

```javascript title="next.config.js" {10-14}
const Dotenv = require("dotenv-webpack");

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    // Add the new plugin to the existing webpack plugins
    config.plugins.push(new Dotenv({ silent: true }));

    return config;
  },
  // Have to list all the environment variables used here to make it available
  // in the client JavaScript bundle
  env: {
    AUTH_SECRET: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
  },
};
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Please be careful about which variables you include in the **env** property as
  they will be included the client JavaScript bundle, so make sure you avoid
  including sensitive data like a database connection string or an
  authentication token secret.
</Callout>

## Wrapping up

You can find an example of the implementation [here](https://github.com/akhila-ariyachandra/next-env-test).
