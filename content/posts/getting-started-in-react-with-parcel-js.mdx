**tl;dr** - Clone and run the [source code](https://github.com/akhila-ariyachandra/react-parcel-starter "React Parcel Starter").

Usually when starting to work on a React project, developers go with **create-react-app**. While this is a great option for many cases, I find it to be a bit too bloated, especially after **ejecting** it. I also find that it takes a little of work to manually setup and maintain a **webpack** config. [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is great for use with React as there is nothing to configure while setting up. It also helps that building the app in Parcel is also really fast.

First lets initialize a project with either `yarn` or `npm`. I'll be using `yarn`.

```shell
yarn init --yes
```

Then let's install Parcel as a dev dependency.

```shell
yarn add parcel-bundler -D
```

After that let's setup **babel** by installing the dev dependencies and creating the `.babelrc` file

```shell
yarn add @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties -D
```

Once the dependencies are done installing create the `.babelrc` file in the project root with the following code.

```json .babelrc
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
  "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"]
}
```

This is all the setup we will need to for Parcel to work with React. Now let's setup React.
First we will need to the React dependencies.

```shell
yarn add react react-dom react-router-dom
```

If you want to use **_async/await_** in your code, an additional dependency is needed.

```shell
yarn add regenerator-runtime -D
```

Next we will need an entry point for out app. The nice thing about Parcel is that the entry file doesn't have to be a JavaScript file. In our case its going to be a HTML file.
Create a folder with the name `src`. This folder is going to contain all the source code. In the `src` folder create the `index.html` file which is going to be the entry point of the app and add the following code.

```html src/index.html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, width=device-width, shrink-to-fit=no"
    />

    <title>React Parcel Starter</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

After that we will create the `index.js` file (also in `src`) which will connect the root React component to the `index.html` file.

```jsx src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App.js";
import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

Next let's create the root component in the `App.js` file. The root component is going to contain the routing configuration.

```jsx src/App.js
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";

// Import pages
import Home from "./pages/home";
import About from "./pages/about";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/about">
          <About />
        </Route>

        <Route path="/">
          <Home />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

After that let's create a layout for our pages. Create the folder `components` in `src` and in it create `Layout.js`. The layout component is also going to contain the navigation links within the app.

```jsx src/components/Layout.js
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">
          <button>Home</button>
        </Link>

        <Link to="/about">
          <button>About</button>
        </Link>
      </nav>

      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

Then let's create the pages. In `src` create a folder called `pages`. The first page we are going to create is the home page.

```jsx src/pages/home.js
import React from "react";
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>React Parcel Starter</h1>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

After that we will create the about page.

```jsx src/pages/about.js
import React from "react";
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

const About = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam sed
        varius ante. Nam venenatis posuere neque ac ultricies. Pellentesque
        pulvinar, enim consequat sagittis semper, neque lorem hendrerit velit,
        at luctus dui ipsum in nunc. Donec vel venenatis augue. Nunc elementum
        blandit elit. Ut a lacinia lorem. Duis non consequat ipsum. Aenean et
        libero ipsum. Duis sollicitudin vitae diam vitae tempor.
      </p>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default About;
```

Finally all that's left to do is to add the scripts to run the app. Add the following in the `package.json` file.

```json package.json focus=9:12
{
  "name": "react-parcel-starter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A starting template for building React apps with Parcel.js",
  "main": "src/index.html",
  "repository": "https://github.com/akhila-ariyachandra/react-parcel-starter.git",
  "author": "akhila-ariyachandra <akhila_ariyachandra@live.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "parcel ./src/index.html",
    "build": "parcel build ./src/index.html"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.4.5",
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties": "^7.4.4",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.4.5",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.0.0",
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.3"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/polyfill": "^7.4.4",
    "react": "^16.8.6",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.6"
  }
}
```

`dev` will be used to run the development of the app. Don't worry about restarting the server after making changes to the code while it's running, as Parcel will automatically take care of that. `build` is used to make the production version of the app in the `dist` folder in the project root.
Let's check if everything has been setup properly by running the `dev` command.

```shell
yarn dev
```

When you visit `localhost:1234` in your browser you should be seeing

<PostImage
  src="/posts/getting-started-in-react-with-parcel-js/home-page.png"
  width={364}
  height={118}
  title="Home Page"
/>

When you navigate to "About" you should see

<PostImage
  src="/posts/getting-started-in-react-with-parcel-js/about-page.png"
  width={625}
  height={287}
  title="About Page"
/>

Now you can continue creating your React app as usual from here. The source code for everything done here is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/akhila-ariyachandra/react-parcel-starter "React Parcel Starter").
