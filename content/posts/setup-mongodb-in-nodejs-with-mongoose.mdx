Chances are if youâ€™re building an application with Node, youâ€™ll be needing to connect it to a MongoDB database. Here Iâ€™ll show you how to set it up. This guide assumes that you have already initialized a node project.

If you donâ€™t have a database already [mLab](https://mlab.com/) is probabaly the best place to get a free one.

## Setting up database connection

First letâ€™s install the mongoose dependency.

```bash
npm install mongoose --save
```

Or with yarn.

```bash
yarn add mongoose
```

Then we will create a file with the database configuration and instance as `database.js` .

First let import the dependency;

```javascript title="database.js"
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```

Then letâ€™s store the path of the database in a variable. The path should look like the following, with _dbuser_ and _dbpassword_ being replaced with a user you have created for the database.

```javascript title="database.js"
const dbPath =
  "mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds250607.mlab.com:38485/test-db";
```

After that weâ€™ll connect to the database.

```javascript database.js
mongoose.connect(dbPath, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
});
```

Weâ€™ll need to export this instance of the database to be used later.

```javascript title="database.js"
module.exports = mongoose;
```

Once the application is started, it would be better if there was an indicator showing whether the application successfully connected to the database or not. So letâ€™s add some more code to fix that.

```javascript title="database.js"
const db = mongoose.connection;

db.on("error", () => {
  console.log("> error occurred from the database");
});

db.once("open", () => {
  console.log("> successfully opened the database");
});
```

In the end the database.js should look like this.

```javascript title="database.js"
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const dbPath =
  "mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds250607.mlab.com:38485/test-db";

mongoose.connect(dbPath, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
});

const db = mongoose.connection;

db.on("error", () => {
  console.log("> error occurred from the database");
});

db.once("open", () => {
  console.log("> successfully opened the database");
});

module.exports = mongoose;
```

## Setting up models/schema

After setting up the database connection, letâ€™s setup an entity model to save and retrieve. For this example in going with an **User** entity. It will have three fields, name, email and password. Weâ€™ll store all the models in the models folder.

```javascript title="models/userModel.js"
const mongoose = require("../database");

const schema = {
  name: { type: mongoose.SchemaTypes.String, required: true },
  email: { type: mongoose.SchemaTypes.String, required: true },
  password: {
    type: mongoose.SchemaTypes.String,
    required: true,
    select: false,
  },
};

const collectionName = "user"; // Name of the collection of documents
const userSchema = mongoose.Schema(schema);
const User = mongoose.model(collectionName, userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

A couple of notes here. The structure of the schema is defined in the schema constant. Each property should have a type field. The required field is to set whether the property is mandatory or not. In the above example all three properties are. The password property has an extra select field set to true. This is to make sure the password property is not returned by default when querying.

Thatâ€™s all the setup you need to start using the database. Below are some examples on how the Model can be used.

```javascript
// Create user
User.create({
  name: name,
  email: email,
  password: password,
});

// Find user by email
User.findOne({
  email: email,
});

// Find user by email with the password field included
User.findOne({
  email: email,
}).select("+password");
```
