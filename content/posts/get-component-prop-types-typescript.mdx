title: "Get the type of a prop in a React component in TypeScript"

**tldr:** Just use the `ComponentProps` type in React to extract the type of prop of a component.

```tsx mark=2:4
import CustomComponent from "component-library";
import type { ComponentProps } from "react";

type PropType = ComponentProps<typeof CustomComponent>["propName"];
```

While upgrading this site to [Next.js 13.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-2), I enabled the new [Statically Typed Links](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-2#statically-typed-links). But doing this broke some my custom components where the `href` had to be passed as a prop, as the `string` type wasn't enough as the type for the `href` prop in the [Next.js Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) component became `UrlObject | __next_route_internal_types__.RouteImpl<UrlObject | __next_route_internal_types__.RouteImpl<unknown>>`.

So I had to find a way to get exact type the prop in the component, since Next.js didn't export the type directly. That's when I came across the `ComponentProps` type in the React package which can be used to get the types of all the props in a component.

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import type { ComponentProps } from "react";

type HrefType = ComponentProps<typeof Link>["href"]; // UrlObject | __next_route_internal_types__.RouteImpl<unknown>
```

Then it was simple as using that type in my custom components. For example, in my `DashboardItem` component, this is how I defined the props.

```tsx mark=5
interface DashboardItemProps {
  title: string;
  link:
    | {
        url: ComponentProps<typeof Link>["href"];
        type: "internal";
      }
    | {
        url: string;
        type: "external";
      };
  queryKey: string;
  url: string;
}
```
