**tl;dr** - Clone and run the [source code](https://github.com/akhila-ariyachandra/react-webpack-starter "React Webpack Starter").

Usually when starting to work on a React project, developers go with **create-react-app**. While this is a great option for many cases, I find it to be a bit too bloated, especially after **ejecting** it. In this post I'll show you how to setup a React project with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). If you prefer to use the [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/) instead of webpack, check out my [post here](https://akhilaariyachandra.com/blog/getting-started-in-react-with-parcel-js "Getting started in React with Parcel.js").

To start let's initialize a project.

```shell
npm init -y
```

Then install the Webpack dependencies as dev dependencies.

```shell
npm install webpack webpack-cli -D
```

After that let's setup **babel** by installing the dev dependencies and creating the `.babelrc` file.

```shell
npm install @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react -D
```

Once the dependencies are done installing create the `.babelrc` file in the project root with the following code.

```json title=".babelrc"
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

Babel will allow us to use **ES6+** feature in code without breaking the functionality for older browsers.

Next we need to configure babel to load all **.js** and **.jsx** files thorough the **babel-loader**. For that create the `webpack.config.js` file in the project root and enter the following configuration.

```javascript title="webpack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Setup React

First install _react_, _react-dom_ and _react-router-dom_ (which we will use for routing).

```shell
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom
```

After that create the `index.js` file in the `src` folder.

```jsx title="src/index.js"
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App.js";
```

Next let's create the root component in the `App.js` file. The root component is going to contain the routing configuration.

```jsx title="src/App.js"
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";

// Import pages
import Home from "./pages/home";
import About from "./pages/about";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/about">
          <About />
        </Route>

        <Route path="/">
          <Home />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

After that let's create a layout for our pages. Create the folder `components` in `src` and in it create `Layout.js`. The layout component is also going to contain the navigation links within the app.

```jsx title="src/components/Layout.js"
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">
          <button>Home</button>
        </Link>

        <Link to="/about">
          <button>About</button>
        </Link>
      </nav>

      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

Then let's create the pages. In `src` create a folder called `pages`. The first page we are going to create is the home page.

```jsx title="src/pages/home.js"
import React from "react";
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>React Parcel Starter</h1>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

After that we will create the about page.

```jsx title="src/pages/about.js"
import React from "react";
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

const About = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam sed
        varius ante. Nam venenatis posuere neque ac ultricies. Pellentesque
        pulvinar, enim consequat sagittis semper, neque lorem hendrerit velit,
        at luctus dui ipsum in nunc. Donec vel venenatis augue. Nunc elementum
        blandit elit. Ut a lacinia lorem. Duis non consequat ipsum. Aenean et
        libero ipsum. Duis sollicitudin vitae diam vitae tempor.
      </p>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default About;
```

## Connecting to a HTML file

Now we need to connect the javascript bundle to a HTML page. Webpack should output and an HTML page and place the javascript bundle in a `<script>` tag.

Install _html-webpack-plugin_ and _html-loader_ as dev dependencies.

```shell
npm install html-webpack-plugin html-loader -D
```

Then update the webpack config.

```javascript title="webpack.config.js"
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.html$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "html-loader",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
      template: "./src/index.html",
      filename: "./index.html",
    }),
  ],
};
```

After that create the HTML file, `index.html` in the `src` folder.

```html title="src/index.html"
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, width=device-width, shrink-to-fit=no"
    />

    <title>React Webpack Starter</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Finally update the `src/index.js` file.

```javascript title="src/index.js" {5}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App.js";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## Webpack development server

If you want to run the project in the development mode you'll need the _webpack-dev-server_ dependency.

```shell
npm install webpack-dev-server -D
```

Next add the **dev** script in `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server --open --mode development"
  }
}
```

Then all you need to start the development server is the following command.

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Production build

To get the production build of the project which is optimized add these scripts to `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server --open --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "prestart": "npm run build",
    "start": "serve dist"
  }
}
```

To serve the production build let's use the _serve_ dependency.

```shell
npm install serve -D
```

- `build` - Will get build the production version of the project.
- `start` - Will start the app.

When you visit `localhost:5000` in your browser after running `npm start`, you should be seeing

<PostImage
  src="/posts/getting-started-in-react-with-webpack/home-page.png"
  width={411}
  height={115}
  title="Home Page"
/>

When you navigate to "About" you should see

<PostImage
  src="/posts/getting-started-in-react-with-webpack/about-page.png"
  width={663}
  height={283}
  title="About Page"
/>

Now you can continue creating your React app as usual from here. The source code for everything done here is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/akhila-ariyachandra/react-webpack-starter "React Webpack Starter").
