Worked on a vehicle service booking appointment system for [Infomedia](https://www.infomedia.com.au/us/). I was in charge of two front-end projects, one for customers to select their vehicle and services, and book an appointment, and another project for the employees at the dealership to see all information related to the booked appointments. Both projects were created with React.

I was also part of the implementation of the [Villvay](https://villvay.com/) company website redesign with Next.js.
