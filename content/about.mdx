I'm a web developer from Sri Lanka.

I discovered my love for **JavaScript** related development when I had to create a **Node.js** API has part of my final year project at university.

I first started learning **React** through developing a **React Native** app in my first job.

Now I'm just trying to continue my pursuit in learning more about **JavaScript**, **React** and **Web Development** through things like **Next.js**, **Gatsby.js** and **GraphQL**, and share what I've learned.
