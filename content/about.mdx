I'm a full stack web developer with a focus on creating front ends with [React](https://reactjs.org/). I'm currently working as an Associate Technical Lead at [Villvay](https://villvay.com).

My current interests in the JavaScript space are on awesome meta frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Even though I focus most of my time on front end work, technologies like [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) keep me interested in backend work too.

I'm always on the lookout for learning and adopting bleeding edge technologies and libraries in the Web/Javascript ecosystem.
