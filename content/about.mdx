I'm a web developer with a focus on creating front ends with [React](https://reactjs.org/). I'm currently working as an Associate Technical Lead at [Villvay Systems (Pvt) Ltd](https://villvay.com).

My current work includes building e-commerce websites using awesome meta frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Even though I focus most of my time on frontend work, features like React Server Components make me work in the backend as well.

I'm always on the lookout for learning and adopting bleeding edge technologies and libraries in the Web/Javascript ecosystem.
