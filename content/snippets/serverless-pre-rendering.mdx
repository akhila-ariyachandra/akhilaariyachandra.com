Extracted from the following [link](https://vercel.com/blog/serverless-pre-rendering "Introducing Serverless Pre-Rendering (SPR)").

Just add the following code where you can access the response object.

```javascript
res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate");
```

Set the `s-maxage` value according to how long you want the CDN to cache the response (in seconds).
